## Notes

Shakeel repairs EVERYTHING, not just iPhones... LOL

Auto Layouts became much easier as I got the hang of it. One pro-tip we should have learned offically is the fact that you can Control+Drag from one storyboard element to another in order to relate both of them in a new Auto Layout constraint... for me, this was an essential technique, since there were occasions when an element couldn't "see" another element in drop-down menus when setting new constraints the "proper" way.
